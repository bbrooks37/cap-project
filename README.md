Project Instructions:
For this step, you'll write a proposal for the site you want to build. This will help your
mentor better understand your chosen capstone project idea.
This proposal should be a 1-2 page document that answers the following questions:
1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.
2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know
everything in advance and that these details might change later).
