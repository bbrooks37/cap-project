Capstone Project Proposal
Project Instructions
For this step, you'll write a proposal for the site you want to build. This will help your mentor better understand your chosen capstone project idea.

This proposal should be a 1-2 page document that answers the following questions:

What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use React and Node for this project; however, if you are extremely interested in becoming a Python developer, you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this project.

Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may not have picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API.

Outline Your Approach
In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later).

Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

What does your database schema look like?
What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important if you are creating your own API, as web scraping produces notoriously messy data.
Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
What functionality will your app include?
What will the user flow look like?
What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?

GitHub Repository
Please create a GitHub repository for this Capstone Project and label it accordingly. All code and further documentation associated with this project should be added to this repository.

Once you've added your proposal, please submit a link to your repository for your mentor to review. You may have to iterate on this submission several times before it is approved.

PAUSE: You will need a mentor's approval before moving on to the next step.
